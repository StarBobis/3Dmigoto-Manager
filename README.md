# 3DmigotoManager
Manage multiple game's 3dmigoto and increase player and mod author's effeciency.

the Armor version of d3d11.dll is forked and modified from original 3Dmigoto repository and can be found at here: https://github.com/StarBobis/3Dmigoto-Armor-23-12-24-fork ,but in V1.2.0 and later version, I add a mod encryption method in source code and lead the repository becomes private again, 
now the open source version of Armor is enough for educational purporse so I archived it.

# 3Dmigoto-Armor's core features
- Dynamic d3d11 desc's byte width increase changed with your mod's vertex number,which will save a lot of memory and avoid memory leak and avoid game crush,it's works better and more stable than GIMI's d3d11.dll's solid d3d11 desc byte width increase number in some special game like NBP.
