# Open source is a kind of sin
No one will thanks you for open source these scripts, they just use your scripts and at the same time verbally attacking you,when i open source reverse scripts seems everyone want to insult me to show their fake ethical, so my project will never be open source again, may be some compiled exe will be published here but never source code again.

# 3DmigotoManager
Manage multiple game's 3dmigoto and increase mod author's effeciency.

It's a very simple tool but solved my problem for using 3dmigoto on multiple game 
but very cumbersome to maintain their file and icons, now we have a unified way.

Notice: the 3Dmigoto-Knife inside this project is forked and modified from original 3Dmigoto's injector but add some extra features, the 3Dmigoto-Armor version of d3d11.dll is forked and modified from original 3Dmigoto repository and can be found at here: https://github.com/StarBobis/3Dmigoto-Armor-23-12-24-fork 
It's a modified version for game mod and it's open source instead of GIMI's d3d11.dll is a closed source version, but two of them have nearly same functions.
